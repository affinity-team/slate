# Field Value Changes

The field value changes API allows you to see historical changes to the values of fields.
This is especially useful for tracking progress through statuses (e.g. Lead --> Closed Won).

**Note:**
Only certain fields have their historical values tracked; the API will return an appropriate
error if the field doesn't support historical tracking.

## The field value change resource

> Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 50822718,
  "field_id": 236333,
  "entity_id": 261131046,
  "list_entry_id": 15709964,
  "action_type": 0,
  "changer": {
    "id": 38706,
    "type": 0,
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "primary_email": "jane@gmail.com",
    "emails": ["jane@gmail.com"]
  },
  "changed_at": "2020-04-11T15:46:50.963-07:00",
  "value": {
    "id": 1607859,
    "text": "New",
    "rank": 1,
    "color": 0
  }
}
```

Each field value change object has a unique `id`.

A field value change also has `field_id`, `entity_id`, `list_entry_id` attributes that give it the
appropriate associations, as noted in the example above.

**Note:**
There are some extra attributes returned by this endpoint; they will be deprecated soon and
should not be used.

| Attribute     | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id            | integer        | The unique identifier of the field value object.                                                                                                                |
| field_id      | integer        | The unique identifier of the field the value is associated with.                                                                                                |
| entity_id     | integer        | The unique identifier of the person, organization, or opportunity object the field value is associated with.                                                    |
| list_entry_id | integer        | The unique identifier of the list entry object the field value is associated with. This only exists if the field the value is associated with is list-specific. |
| value         | One of many    | The value attribute can take on many different types, depending on the field `value_type`. See below for reference.                                             |
| action_type   | One of several | The action_type attribute can take on several different types. See below for reference.                                                                         |

### Field Value Change action types

The Action Type specified below corresponds to the `action_type` of a field value change.
This attribute is required, and filters the Field Value Changes that are returned. For example,
when an `action_type` of 0 is specified, all the Field Value Change objects that are returned
will represent when a Field Value has been created.

| Action Type | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 0           | Created |
| 1           | Updated |
| 2           | Deleted |

# Data Model
The two top-level objects in Affinity are Persons and Organizations, and everything in the
product is centered around these two concepts.

Affinity is like a complete spreadsheet. As we know, any spreadsheet has many rows, many columns
and many cells. There are direct equivalents of each of those concepts in Affinity.

The first concept is that of a spreadsheet itself - the Affinity equivalent is called a List.
A List is a collection of many rows, and the Affinity equivalent of a row is a List Entry.

Each column in a spreadsheet is represented by an Entity Attribute in Affinity, and the value in
each cell is represented by an Entity Value.

# Data Model
The two top-level objects in Affinity are Persons and Organizations, and everything in the
product is centered around these two resources. We refer to a data model that is either
a person or organization as an Entity.

The data stored in Affinity can be easily understood as a spreadsheet, with many rows,
columns and cells. For each part of a spreadsheet, there are directly equivalent
data models in Affinity.

The List in Affinity represents the spreadsheet itself. A List is a collection of many rows, and the Affinity equivalent of a row is a List Entry. Each column in a spreadsheet is represented by a "Field" in Affinity, and the value in each cell is represented by a "Field Value".

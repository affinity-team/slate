Just like field values, notes are used to keep track of state on an entity. They could be
notes manually taken from due diligence, a meeting, or a call. Or, notes could be used to
store logged activity from a prospect's visit to your website.

addition, a note can be associated with multiple people or organizations. Each person or
organization will display linked notes on their profiles.

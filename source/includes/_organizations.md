# Organizations
An organization in Affinity represents an external company that your team is in touch
with- this could be an organization you're trying to invest in, sell to, or establish a
relationship with.

An organization has many people associated with it - these are your team's points of
contacts at that organization. Just like people, organizations can be added to multiple
lists and can be assigned field values.

To make the data quality as good as possible, we have our own proprietary database of
organizations that we have developed through third-party partnerships and web scraping.
We use this database to minimize data entry for you as you use Affinity's CRM products.

**Note:**

1. If you are looking to add or remove an organization from a list, please check out the
[List Entries](#list-entries) section of the API.
2. If you are looking to modify a field value (one of the cells on Affinity's
spreadsheet), please check out the [Field Values](#field-values) section of the API.

## The organization resource

> Example Response

```json
{
  "id":64779194,
  "name":"Affinity",
  "domain":"affinity.co",
  "global":false,
  "person_ids":[89734, 117270, 138123, 274492, 304848, ...]
}
```
Each organization object has a unique `id`. It also has a `name`, `domain` (the website
of the organization), and `persons` associated with it. The `domain` is an important
attribute from an automation perspective, as it helps Affinity automatically link all
the appropriate person objects to the organization.

Each organization also has a flag determining whether it's `global` or not. As mentioned
above, Affinity maintains its own database of global organizations that each customer has
access to. Note that you cannot change the name or the domain of a `global`
organization. You also cannot delete a `global` organization.

Of course, if an organization is manually created by your team, all fields can be
modified and the organization can be deleted.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
id | integer | The unique identifier of the organization object.
name | integer | The name of the organization (see below).
domain | string | The website name of the organization. This is used by Affinity to automatically associate person objects with an organization.
person_ids | string[] | An array of unique identifiers of person that are associated with the organization
global | boolean | Returns whether this organization is a part of Affinity's global dataset of organizations. This is always false if the organization was created by you.

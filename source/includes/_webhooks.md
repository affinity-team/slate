# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to be notified of events that happen on your Affinity instance. For example, your app can be notified when a list is created, a field value is updated, a person is deleted, and more.

## Create a Webhook Subscription

We don't currently support this via the API. Please reach out to support@affinity.co with the URL you would like us to POST webhooks to.

## Limitations

- A webhook subscription automatically subscribes to all events, there is currently
no way to only subscribe to certain events.
- The following triggers will not create webhook events:
	- resources created/updated/deleted via our importer tool
	- resources created/updated/delete via Email Bot.
	- organizations created automatically based on email/event interactions.
	- automated global organization fields (i.e. location, last round raised, etc.)
